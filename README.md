# A Simple Life
A responsive blog on minimalism.

## Objectives
My primary learning objective behind this project was to become proficient with designing highly responsive and fluid layouts. Some other things that I learned were:
- Thematic Consistency
- Fiddling with display order to give a completely native feel 
(no matter the screen size)
